          <img src="images/now-novel-1.jpg" class="responsive-image my-3" /><br><br>
          <strong>About the project</strong><br>
          This was a group project completed while I was studying User Centred Design at Red & Yellow – Creative School of Business. Our task was to look at Now Novel – a desktop application that helps aspiring writers complete their first novel through offering coaching and online sources, as well as a plot outlining tool and a community section for aspiring novelists to receive feedback on their writing from other community members. The main research objective was to identify why users aren’t engaging with the critique feature as much as they do with other features of the site, such as the plot outlining tool. To understand what Now Novel’s business goals are and how users are interacting with the site, we conducted a stakeholder interview, a competitive analysis, a heuristic analysis, as well as direct observation and usability testing. My role in this project was to conduct the usability testing and do a write-up on the results, which I have included below. 
          <br><br>
          <h4>Usability testing – results and recommendations</h4>
          
          <strong>Method</strong><br>
          To understand exactly where the pain points are and how users are currently interacting with the site, we conducted a usability test with five participants. According to Steve Krug, “Usability tests are about watching one person at a time try to use something (whether it’s a Web site, a prototype, or some sketches of a new design) to do typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse or frustrate them (Krug, S. 2013: Online).”
          
          Beyond silently observing, it was important to give participants tasks to complete and get their insights on what they are thinking as they complete them. This provided us with a deeper understanding of what parts of the critique-giving process need to be prioritised for improvement. 
        <br><br>
        <strong class="text-start">Recruitment</strong><br>
        Brendan mentioned that the majority of their users are tech savvy so, we found participants that are frequent internet users, and have some interest in literature and writing. Although not all of them fit into the main target, which is majority female and in the age group of 25 to 45. We tested three males and two females, and ages ranged from 23 to 40. We will refer to each participant by their order of testing, P1 to P5.
        <br><br>
        In a pre-test conversation, we asked participants if they could tell us how often they use the internet, what they mainly use it for, and what genre of novel they would write if they were to write one. This determined whether they
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Are comfortable using the internet</li>
<li>Have an interest in literature</li>
</ol>
All participants said that they use the internet relatively frequently for various reasons, from work or varsity-related research, to checking the news, promoting art, watching series, social media, emailing, online learning and watching YouTube tutorials. One participant (P2) mentioned that he was studying coding. 
<br><br>
Three participants said they have considered writing a novel (P1, P2, P4), and one was interested in writing a film script (P5). The one remaining participant said she is not good with languages and would not consider writing a novel (P3). Four out of five participants had a favourite genre, except for the participant who was not interested in writing a novel (P3). 
<br><br>
It is therefore fair to say that all participants are comfortable with using the internet, and four out of five have some interest in literature and writing.
<br><br><strong>Testing</strong><br>
For the purpose of the test, we asked participants to imagine that they wanted to start writing a novel, and prompted them to complete the following tasks while thinking out loud:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Get feedback on an excerpt of your novel</li>
  <li>Give feedback to another user</li>
  <li>Interact in a group</li>
</ul>
In order to complete the first task, users had to sign up first, and then decide if they wanted to go through the plot development process that is prompted after sign up, or go straight to the feedback section. However, we found that they often forgot where they were in the process, and an additional prompt to post an excerpt of their novel for feedback was necessary.
<br><br>
Before starting the usability test, and after conducting the naturalistic direct observation, we asked participants what they thought the website’s main message was. After completing the tasks, we asked this question again to determine if their understanding of what the website’s purpose was had changed after they had signed up and engaged with the feedback feature. To gain deeper insight into the experience our participants were having, we asked further questions:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Were you aware that there was a reward for giving feedback to other users?</li>
<li>If you were aware that you would receive more feedback for your own excerpt for giving more feedback to others, would this motivate you to give more feedback? 
  </li>
  <li>What did you find exciting about the website?</li>
  <li>If you were to use the website again, what features would you use next time?</li>
</ol>
Beyond noting where participants’ got confused, we wanted to know if participants are aware of the community message and how the critique feature works before they signed up and saw the “community” navbar item. We also thought that it would be important to know whether participants realised that they get rewarded for giving more feedback in order to determine if this works as a motivation. Lastly, of course finding out what worked for them was useful in order to prioritise what features need the most attention. Two of our tests were conducted in person, with one of us observing the screen and another observing facial expressions. The remaining tests were conducted remotely, and we recorded every session via Zoom.
<br><br>
<strong>Finding 1: Participants had difficulties locating the critique feature</strong><br>
When asked to post an excerpt of their novel, even when reminded that this was their task after signing up, all five out of five participants weren’t sure about where to do this. Two participants went to their profile first (P2 and P4), one participant (P1) was wondering whether he should post it on the blog, and the remaining two (P3 and P5) looked under “Story”, even after seeing the “Scribble Pad” option. P4 specifically said, “Scribble Pad seems so random” with regards to the wording to look out for to complete this task. P3 said, when asked if she was confused, “I think it’s just the wording for me, it doesn’t flow for it to be for you to put in your personal work and then get feedback from one person.” The other participants further commented that they didn’t know what to do, “I’m a bit lost, I won’t even lie to you guys.” (P5) or “I kind of have no idea where to do that” (P2). Most participants eventually found it under “Scribble Pad” or the community drop-down, but P2 had to be told where to post their excerpt.
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation 1: Make the critique feature more prominent</strong><br>
As a first step we recommend changing the wording of “Scribble Pad” to something that is a clear description of the task, such as “Get feedback” or “Post excerpt”. This is easy to implement and would avoid a lot of confusion. Secondly, although the navbar heading “community” makes sense in terms of Now Novel’s message, it would be less confusing to users if the heading was an appropriate description of what the critique feature entails, such as “Feedback”. But more importantly, if one of the main goals is to get users to interact with the critique feature more, then it would be useful to implement a prominent call-to-action on the dashboard page after signing up. Currently, the user is prompted to use the outlining tool, which is an involved process that, when observing participants who filled it in, led them to forget that the task was to post an excerpt for feedback. Perhaps the user could be presented with a clean page after completing sign-up, with an option to work on their story outline, which if clicked would link to the outlining tool, or give feedback to other users, which would link to the critique feature.
<br><br>
<strong>Finding 2: Participants aren’t aware that there is a reward for providing feedback</strong><br>
After completing all three tasks that involved engaging with the critique feature, none of the participants were aware that there is a reward system that allows them to get more feedback if they provide more feedback. They were also not aware that users get badged as super users for providing regular feedback of decent quality. Once told that there was a reward, P4 went back to the Give Critique page and found the sentence saying, “Each time you give a detailed critique, it increases the chance you will receive more quality feedback in return,” and commented that this didn’t stand out to her at all. We also observed that most of the participants did not read all the text in detail. 
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation 2: Create a more prominent reward message </strong><br>
To motivate users to give more critique to users, it is necessary for them to understand the value of providing feedback. This could be done by making the message in the critique feature stand out more, through giving it a different background, larger font or different colour. But since most participants didn’t spend much time reading the information in detail, visual icons representing a good kharma system could perhaps be used to draw attention to the reward system. It is also important that the user is presented with this information early on in the process and on the homepage, so they are motivated to sign up and give feedback.
<br><br>
<strong>Finding 3: Now Novel’s aim of providing community features (including the critique feature) for aspiring writers only becomes clear after sign up</strong><br>
Before signing up, participants thought the main aim of the website was education, through Now Novel’s blog and online courses, and coaching. Some participants were aware that finding a like-minded community of aspiring writers was part of the process, but few were aware that this entailed getting free feedback from other users in return for providing feedback. Instead, they thought that they were asked to sign up for paid services, such as courses, coaching and editing. However, after going through the tasks and using critique features, they said they realised that “community” was a much larger component of the site than they had initially thought. P3 said, for instance, “I didn’t realise how big the community section was for this website, to be able to interact with people without having to sign up for a course.”
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation 3: Include information about the critique feature on the homepage</strong><br>
To motivate visitors to subscribe, we recommend creating a section on the homepage that gives clear information about the value of the critique feature, that it’s free and that it’s a safe space to share their work, privately or publicly. This could be presented in a similar way as the cards under “Which stage of writing are you in?” It would also be helpful to keep the link to the critique feature in the navbar, but have it link to a call-to-action prompting users to sign up and get free critiques on their work. The use of icons and imagery that symbolise community and good karma would also assist in making the message stand out.
<br><br>
<strong>Finding 4: The navbar item “group” links to a community page with all three options: groups, critique and submissions</strong><br>
When P1 was trying to post a novel excerpt, he ended up on the page that the “groups” link leads to. He was confused because it shows options to all three components of the feedback feature, as well as the group feed and critique queue. “Not sure what the purpose of this is. Looks like a summary of what’s happening on the site, not relevant to me.” P3 also clicked on “groups” as she was trying to find the critique feature, and mentioned that this page was not what she was expecting. 
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation 4: Link “Groups” to the page where you can join a group</strong><br>
To avoid this confusion, we recommend linking the “groups” drop-down item directly to the page where users can join a group. The page that shows all community items – Your Groups, Your Critique Submissions, Your Scribbles and Critique Activity – could be useful to have one level up, perhaps on the dashboard page so users have an idea of what the community part of the website entails. A “community” dropdown link could perhaps also link to this page.
<br><br>
<strong>Finding 5: Participants found it hard to navigate back to where they were when clicking on a wrong link</strong><br>
P1 and P5 ended up on a page they did not intend to be on when looking for the critique feature. P5 was not able to find his way back to where he wanted to be, and P1 commented that he was confused about where he was in the process. “I didn’t know where I was. There are no headings or indications of what page I’m on” (P1).
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation 5: Add a breadcrumb</strong><br>
A breadcrumb that shows where the user is in their journey would help them keep track of what pages they have navigated to, and provide an easy way for them to navigate back to where they were if they click on the link. It would provide them with assurance that they are always able to correct such a mistake if needed.

<strong>What participants enjoyed about the site</strong><br>
All participants said that they thought it was a really great idea, and specifically mentioned that the community feature – as a way to connect with like-minded people – is really promising. When asked what feature they would want to use the most, P4 and P5 emphasised that they really liked the outlining tool, and that it would provide great value to them. “I would definitely use the one that helps you try and build your characters. I really like that because it kind of gave me more of an idea of the character that I am building for myself” (P4). P2 and P3 said that they would use the community feature to connect with other writers and give and get feedback, and P1 said he would be interested in the courses. 
<br><br>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Now Novel has great potential for building their community section, and integrating it with their online education and coaching offering. Users like the message, and once made aware, see the value in exchanging feedback with other writers. The suggested improvements – to highlight the community message more and improve the usability of the critique feature – are not difficult to implement but would provide great benefit to the user, and thus the business.
