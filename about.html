      <h1 class="fw-bold pt-4">About me</h1>
      <p>I got into e-learning design and web development by accident. If it wasn’t for lockdown and some lucky coincidences, I might still be under the impression that programming is mystical and unreachable, something only people with special powers understand.
        In 2021, I spent a lot of my time learning to code: from HTML, CSS and JavaScript and frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and Vue JS, to backend languages such as PHP and MySQL. By the end of year, I built this full-stack portfolio e-commerce site to showcase what I learned – something I may not have thought possible a year earlier.  
        I created my own API using PHP and MySQL to pull data from a database to be displayed on the frontend – a separate project I designed and developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript – through making Fetch API calls to the backend. This really helped me to understand how client-side languages and server-side languages interact with each other, even though they are separate entities with different purposes. 
        <br><br>
        Since mid-2020, I’ve also been assisting an e-learning designer as a freelancer. I learned how to work with Moodle, creating layouts and populating pages with content, designing infographics in Adobe Illustrator and Articulate Storyline, and applying my newly acquired coding skills to create learning interactions. Working with pre-coded H5P interactions in Moodle is what inspired me to learn how to code. I wanted to apply more creativity and control and – <i>one day</i> – be able to build fully customised learning experiences. Discovering e-learning experience design has opened up a massive scope for opportunity and satisfaction – it combines my vast interests into a streamlined process with a goal: to bring concepts closer to people using technology and creativity. 
        <br><br>
        I have a background in journalism, studying Film and Media Production at UCT and writing articles for publications such as <a class="fw-bold" href="https://www.groundup.org.za/author/22/"
        target="_blank">GroundUp</a> or <a class="fw-bold" href="https://africasacountry.com/author/christine-hogg"
        target="_blank">Africa is a Country</a>. Pre-Covid, I worked as an events photographer and created <a class="fw-bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDl6Q08RZM4&ab_channel=ChristineHogg"
        target="_blank">a mini documentary</a> about the tango community in Cape Town. 
        <br><br>
        Things I love: the ocean, learning to play musical instruments (violin, Irish bouzouki, bodhrán and bones), and dancing tango.

        Future plans: learning UX design.
